Dear Wells Fargo Loan Department,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to formally request the addition of payment protection to my exi=
sting loan account. Given the current uncertainties, I believe having this co=
verage would provide an added layer of security for myself and my family.

For your reference, my account details are as follows:
- Full Name: John Doe
- Account Number: 123456789
- Contact Information: johndoe@email.com | (555) 123-4567

I would greatly appreciate your prompt consideration of this request and look=
 forward to your response.

Sincerely,
John Doe
